# ElectricVehicleDiscordBot
This application is written in Javascript, and uses Node as well as a few node packages. The discord bot will take user input of an origin city, destination city, 
user choice of electric vehicle, and the starting charge of the battery. The bot will inform the user of which electric vehicle charging stations to stop at to reach their 
destination without running out of battery charge during their trip. The bot will also give an approximation of time spent charging the vehicle, with a best case scenario and 
a worst case scenario. Trip distance and the number of charging stations along the route are also calculated and shown to the user.
